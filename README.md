# CALCULATE LANGUAGES

### This is my own aproximation of the proyect presented by @MikeTeachesCode in context of the course "Master Python and GitHub with Real World Projects".

-The original proyect was focused in choose a folder to investigate the proportion of programming languages in that selected directory and be able to show
the information via bar graphs.

-My version includes the possibility to analyze the extension of all files in dir in first instance, and gives the user the posibility to analyze the proportion of each programming languages if you are sure all files in the selected directory are programming scripts.

#### The script is divided in 6 parts:

- Part 1: Request the user to indicate the folder name to analyze

- Part 2: Count number of files of each extension and its percentage

- Part 3: Count number of code lines wirtten in each file (optional)

- Part 4: Count number of code lines wirtten in each language (optional)

- Part 5: Display on screen and save a .png file with the file extension analysis.

- Part 6: Display on screen and save a .png file with the language programming analysis (optional).
